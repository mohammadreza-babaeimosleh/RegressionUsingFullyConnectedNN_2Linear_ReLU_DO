# RegressionUsingFullyConnectedNN_2Linear_ReLU_DO.ipynb
implementing Linear Regression using  neural network containing two linear layer and a ReLU activation function and also a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting to data

## Dataset
you can download dataset from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/bike-sharing-dataset) URL 

## requirements
after installing requirement.txt file using command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Note 
hiddenlayer is a graphical simulator that can implement different layers of neural network for better understanding you might have some problems with it in that case, you can go to pytorch_builder.py source file and change _optimize_trace to _optimize_graph this will solve the problem or you can simply comment this part and skip it
